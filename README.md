# README/ROADMAP
🗑️TrashClick🗑️
TrashClick is an highscore clicker game built for Gorbagana. Players connect their wallet, click falling trash, 
and are rewarded with GOR tokens for achieving high scores. You can also complete challenges to get double points when playing for a period of time.

💡 Why I Chose TrashClick
I chose the concept of TrashClick because it felt fun, unique, and different from typical gambling formats like coin flips or basic casino games.

With TrashClick, I'm building a reward and risk system within an actual game, which makes it both entertaining and engaging. You're not just clicking a button to gamble — you're actively playing a game, improving your skills, and aiming for a high score.

When the 1v1 PvP mode is added, the game will naturally introduce a competitive betting element, where players can compete in real time for prize pools. This adds excitement and strategy , a gambling mechanic built into real gameplay not just chance.

How does the game looks now?
I think the game looks pretty simple for now, but that will change. Once I have more time, I plan to polish the visuals, add animations, 
and improve the overall user experience step by step. 
I’m fully committed to making TrashClick much better and more fun over time.

What I build so far
-The game 
-Rewards So people keep playing,try getting higer scores and also just get a reward for playing my game
-Chat to talk with other players
-Leaderboard that shows top 100 players (ran against some problems so still fixing that)
-Profile (only for yourself with stats)
-Gorbagana info with a live price and with some info

Gorbagana Integration
Rewards (GOR tokens):
For every 100 points scored (from 100 up to 1500), you receive 0.01 GOR.
(Maximum reward per game = 0.15 GOR) I did the rewards system like this for now

Automatic payouts:
The backend detects new high scores and instantly sends the corresponding GOR tokens to the player’s wallet within a few seconds.

🛣️ Roadmap
I'm planning to work on TrashClick over a longer period and turn it into something truly fun and engaging. 
While I initially built everything quickly just to participate on time, this is just the beginning. 
I genuinely see this trash game as a long-term project with real potential.

🔮 Upcoming Plans (Next Days/Weeks)
-1v1 PvP Mode
A real-time player-versus-player mode where two players compete against each other for a prize pool. This feature is mainly aimed at degens who love competition and the thrill of high-stakes play.
-Game Expansion & Visual Improvements
I plan to greatly expand the game content and make it visually more appealing and polished.
-Fully Functional Leaderboard
The leaderboard should be up and running soon — this is a key priority for the near term.

That's what I have in mind for now. I also hope to receive valuable feedback from players, which I’ll use to improve and evolve the game further.
